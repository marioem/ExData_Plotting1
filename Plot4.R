#  Filename: Plot4.R
#   Version: 1.0.0
#      Date: 2015.09.09
#    Author: Mariusz Musia≈Ç
# Rev. Info: 1.0.0 - initial version of the script
#
# This script generates a plot with four subplots from the data of
# Individual household electric power consumption Data Set available from
# UCI Machine Learning repository 
# https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption
#
#         Input: household_power_consumption.txt 
#        Output: Plot4.png file
#     Execution: run this script from your current working directory using 
#                source("Plot4.R")
# Prerequisites: 1) this script is located in your current working directory
#                2) Input file is located in the current working directory
#                3) input file is ordered by date and time, ascending
#  Dependencies: dplyr

# Data reading.
# Only the required time frame is read. To do this, first we calculate how many
# lines are to be skipped, then we calculate how many lines are to be read.
# This code works only if the data in the input file is ordered by date and time, ascending.
# Data reading code is common for all Plotx.R scripts, however it is not delegated
# to a separate function to ease script reading and analysis.
# This code is not very R-ish, maybe I'll find some more compact way to do this in
# the furure.
